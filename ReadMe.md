# mlx9064x

`mlx9064x` is a library for using the MLX90640 and MLX90641 thermal cameras from
Melexis. It's `no_std`, but these cameras require a fair bit of memory and
processing power to use fully.

This library is still under development, but the final API will be pretty close
to the current one.
