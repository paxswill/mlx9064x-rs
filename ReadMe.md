# mlx9064x

`mlx9064x` is a library for using the MLX90640 (and eventually) MLX90641 thermal
cameras from Melexis. It's `no_std`, but these cameras require a fair bit of
memory and processing power to use fully.

This library is still in an early stage, (as reflected by the pre-0.1.0
version), so there's liable to a lot of churn before it settles into a usable
API.
